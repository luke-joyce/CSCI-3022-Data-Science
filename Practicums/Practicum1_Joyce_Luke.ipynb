    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "This practicum is due on Canvas by **11:59 PM on Friday October 11**. Your solutions to theoretical questions should be done in Markdown/MathJax directly below the associated question.  Your solutions to computational questions should include any specified Python code and results as well as written commentary on your conclusions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Here are the rules:** \n",
    "\n",
    "1. All work, code and analysis, must be your own. \n",
    "1. You may use your course notes, posted lecture slides, textbooks, in-class notebooks, and homework solutions as resources.  You may also search online for answers to general knowledge questions like the form of a probability distribution function or how to perform a particular operation in Python/Pandas. \n",
    "1. This is meant to be like a coding portion of your midterm exam. So, the instructional team will be much less helpful than we typically are with homework. For example, we will not check answers, help debug your code, and so on.\n",
    "1. If something is left open-ended, it is because we want to see how you approach the kinds of problems you will encounter in the wild, where it will not always be clear what sort of tests/methods should be applied. Feel free to ask clarifying questions though.\n",
    "2. You may **NOT** post to message boards or other online resources asking for help.\n",
    "3. You may **NOT** copy-paste solutions *from anywhere*.\n",
    "4. You may **NOT** collaborate with classmates or anyone else.\n",
    "5. In short, **your work must be your own**. It really is that simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Violation of the above rules will result in an immediate academic sanction (*at the very least*, you will receive a 0 on this practicum or an F in the course, depending on severity), and a trip to the Honor Code Council.\n",
    "\n",
    "**By submitting this assignment, you agree to abide by the rules given above.**\n",

    "- Do **NOT** load or use any Python packages that are not available in Anaconda 3.6. \n",
    "- Some problems with code may be autograded.  If we provide a function API **do not** change it.  If we do not provide a function API then you're free to structure your code however you like. \n",
    "- Submit only this Jupyter notebook to Canvas.  Do not compress it using tar, rar, zip, etc. \n",
    "- This should go without saying, but... For any question that asks you to calculate something, you **must show all work to receive credit**. Sparse or nonexistent work will receive sparse or nonexistent credit.\n",

Therefore there is no number of ducks that will make the policy worth it. The reason they are buying it is so they still have some means of paying the million dollars if a special duck is ever drawn.

    "The histogram I generated above has 3 distinct bar value - 15000 at a frequency of 42, 15886.58 at a frequency of 7, and 16773.17 at a frequency of 1. The probability that the rotary club pays out the millions dollar prize for 3333 duck race as we calculated above is $\\frac{1}{3333}=3.0003*10^{-4}$. Averages of 15000 on the histogram represent instances of the rotary club paying out the million dollar prize not once out of 1111 races. Likewise, averages of 15886.58 on the histogram represent instances of the rotary club paying out the million dollar prize once out of 1111 races, and averages of 16773.17 reprsent instances of the rotary club having to pay out the million dollar price twice out of 1111 races. So according to the histogram, the number of times the rotaryb club paid out the million dollar prize is 42(0) + 7(1) + 1(2) = 9, and there are $1111*50=55550$ races in total, so the apparent probability of the rotary club having to pay out the million dollar prize based off the histogram is $\\frac{9}{55550}=1.6201*10^{-4}$, which is relatively close (also on the lower end of all the times I ran this code) to $3.0003*10^{-4}$, the probability for that vent that we calculated earlier."

    "Let $X =$ the leading digit of a randomly selected number from a large accounting ledger. So, for example, if we randomly draw the number $\\$20,695$, then $X = 2$. People who make up numbers to commit accounting fraud tend to give $X$ a (discrete) uniform distribution, i.e., $P(X = x) = 1/9$, for $x \\in \\{1,...,9\\}$. However, there is empirical evidence that suggests that \"naturally occurring\" numbers (e.g., numbers in a non-fraudulent accounting ledger) have leading digits that do not follow a uniform distribution. Instead, they follow a distribution defined by:\n",

    "- Straight (Sequence of 5 cards in increasing value, Ace can only follow K)\n",

    "To find the probability of selecting 5 cards with at least one pair, we must find the probability of getting one pair and union it with the probability of getting two pairs.

So the total number of hands that either has one or two pairs is 123,552 + 1,098,240 = 1,221,792, which means the probability of either of these events occuring is $\\frac{1,221,792}{2598960} = 0.4701$. \n",
